Wealth of Nations Dataset Analysis

Overview


This repository contains the analysis of the Wealth of Nations dataset using Excel and Tableau. The dataset provides insights into various socio-economic factors across different countries. The analysis primarily focuses on GDP, smartphone usage, and life expectancy, presenting the findings through charts and dashboards.

Excel Analysis

In the Excel portion of the project, the dataset was cleaned, filtered, and sorted to prepare it for analysis. Charts were created to visualize the relationships between GDP, smartphone users, and life expectancy. Additionally, measures were taken to ensure the security of the Excel file through protection mechanisms.

Tableau Dashboard

The cleaned dataset was imported into Tableau to create an interactive dashboard. The dashboard features four visuals:

GDP vs. Smartphone Users: A scatter plot depicting the relationship between a country's GDP and its smartphone users.

Life Expectancy at Birth: A bar chart showcasing the life expectancy at birth for different countries.

Number of Smartphone Users: A line chart illustrating the trend in the number of smartphone users over time.

Additional Insights: Space for additional insights or visualizations based on the dataset.

Usage

The Excel file contains the cleaned dataset and charts for reference.
To explore the interactive dashboard, open the Tableau workbook (.twbx) file.

This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of socio-economic indicators using the Wealth of Nations dataset. By leveraging both Excel and Tableau, meaningful insights are drawn, facilitating a deeper understanding of the relationships between GDP, smartphone usage, and life expectancy across different countries.
